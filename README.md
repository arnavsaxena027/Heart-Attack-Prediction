# ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Attack Prediction

A Jupyter Notebook project that explores predicting heart attack risk using multiple machine learning models on the "heart.csv" dataset.

---

## üìÅ Repository Files

- `HeartattackpredictionH1.ipynb`: Main notebook containing all code, data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- `heart.csv`: Dataset containing heart health indicators.
- `correlation_h1.csv`: CSV file containing correlation values between features extracted from the dataset.
- `o2Saturation.csv`: CSV file with oxygen saturation data extracted or aggregated for analysis.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

---

## üß† What It Does

- Loads `heart.csv` into a pandas DataFrame.
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations within the notebook.
- Computes and saves feature correlations (`correlation_h1.csv`).
- Possibly uses `o2Saturation.csv` for related analysis‚Äîno separate script.
- Trains and evaluates **at least four** different machine learning models within the notebook.
- Models and results (e.g., accuracy, confusion matrices) are presented in the notebook outputs.

## üì¶ Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed to run the notebook:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
